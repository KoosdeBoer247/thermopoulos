PYROX — dynamic heat-risk model (readable reference implementation)
================================================================================
A control-theoretic model of multi-day heat strain, implemented so that every
variable name says what it means and every equation is traceable to the paper:

    de Boer, K. (2026). "A Control-Theoretic Framework for Dynamic Heat Risk
    Assessment: Modeling Acclimatization, Cumulative Strain, and Stability
    Thresholds During Multi-Day Heat Exposure." Research Square.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PRINCIPLE BEING MODELLED (plain language)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2026-09] Corrected from an earlier "two competing loops" description (a
protective loop racing an undermining loop). That is not what the equations
do, and the correction matters enough to state plainly here, not only in the
plotting code: acclimatization is a straight-through DAMPING PATH driven by
the external forcing, not a loop -- it does not itself respond to strain.
There is exactly ONE closed feedback loop in this model. What follows
describes that structure.

Heat strain is driven by two things: a direct forcing effect, and a single
feedback loop that can undermine the body's response to that forcing.

  * THE FORCING'S DIRECT EFFECT, and a DAMPING PATH it also drives.
    Heat exposure (baseline_heat_load) raises cumulative strain directly.
    It also drives acclimatization: repeated exposure builds up short-term
    adaptation, which lowers the load the body actually experiences, which
    slows strain accumulation. This damping path has a START-UP DELAY --
    adaptation is driven by a memory of the PAST ~10 days, so it cannot act
    on day one of a heatwave -- but it is not itself a loop: nothing here
    yet depends on strain. On its own, this would be an ordinary stable
    system (more exposure, more damping, no instability).

  * THE ONE REINFORCING LOOP — strain erodes the net benefit of
    acclimatization. Once load exceeds a recovery threshold, strain
    accumulates. As accumulated strain rises, the NET PROTECTIVE BENEFIT of
    acclimatization declines (the coupling term 1 - kappa*Sigma), which
    raises the experienced load again, which makes strain grow faster.
    Trace the polarity around this one cycle -- strain (+ on suppression)
    -> suppression (\u2212 on effective acclimatization) -> acclimatization
    (\u2212 on strain) -- and the product of three negatives-and-positives is
    positive: a self-reinforcing loop, not a balancing one. This loop acts
    from day one and is the only closed cycle in the model.

    NOTE — net effect, not mechanism: the term (1 - kappa*Sigma) is an effective
    description, NOT a claim that strain physiologically blocks the manufacture
    of adaptation. Physiology is regime-dependent — mild recoverable strain can
    ENHANCE adaptation (permissive dehydration), while acclimatization decays
    when unmaintained (~1 day lost per 2 days without exposure; Daanen, Racinais
    & Periard 2018, doi:10.1007/s40279-017-0808-x). This model's domain is
    sustained, uncompensable heat in vulnerable groups, where accumulated strain
    coincides with eroding net protection.

Because the damping path starts late and the reinforcing loop acts from day
one, the outcome depends on which wins first:
  * under a mild load, damping gets ahead before the loop can bite, and
    strain stabilises safely (an equilibrium_strain exists below critical);
  * under a severe load, the reinforcing loop overtakes the damping path
    before it can engage, net protection falls to zero, and strain runs
    away to critical_strain regardless of starting point (no equilibrium
    exists -- see equilibrium_strain()'s three-way "safe" / "equilibrium" /
    "runaway" result below).

The critical level is not a tuned threshold — it falls out of the algebra of the
suppression term (see CRITICAL_STRAIN below). A population group is "vulnerable"
precisely when its damping path is too weak to get ahead of the reinforcing loop
under the same heat that a resilient group would ride out safely.

    THE FOUR PROTECTIVE / VULNERABILITY KNOBS
    -----------------------------------------
    For the model to be internally coherent, every parameter that PROTECTS a
    group must move together along the resilient -> vulnerable axis. A resilient
    group has:
        - HIGH max_acclimatization_capacity  (strong protective loop)

        - a STEEP exposure_memory (recent days weighted more, faster adaptation)
    A vulnerable group has all of these low. (This is exactly why the published
    parameter table had to be corrected — see pyrox_groups.py.)

    strain_suppression_strength is the odd one out: it is not a "protective" knob

    The exposure memory is not a free parameter: it stores the exposure signals
    of the days BEFORE the simulation window. For "what is the risk during an
    expected heatwave?", the population enters the heatwave already acclimatized
    to the recent baseline weather. We model that by filling the whole memory
    with the exposure signal of a representative pre-heatwave load:

        exposure_memory = [ exposure_signal(pre_heatwave_heat_load) ] * N

    This uses the SAME exposure_signal() transform as the dynamics, so the start
    can never drift from the model. It is the most neutral self-consistent start:
    it assumes only "the population was in equilibrium with recent conditions",
    no hidden scenario about the wider world.

    Special cases expressible through the one argument:
        * cold-climate arrival (legacy cold start): pre_heatwave_heat_load -> very
          low, giving a near-zero memory;
        * pre-acclimatization study (paper Sec 4.3): raise pre_heatwave_heat_load.
