=========================
Heat Exposure Stress & Thermophysiology Integrated Assessment -- Data Engine
with Cardiovascular Response (CVR) integration.

This script combines two specialised simulation models:
  1. Adults  -- JOS-3 thermoregulation + CVR module + collapse risk model.
  2. Children / adolescents -- JOS-3 thermoregulation (no CVR).

The user selects the simulation mode at startup; the script then automatically
adjusts physiological parameters, activity levels (MET), and perception models.

=============================================================================
COMMON FEATURES
=============================================================================
- JOS-3 thermoregulation model (Takahashi et al. 2021, Energy & Buildings).
- Monte Carlo simulation for population-based risk analysis (default N=5000).
- Environmental modelling: Open-Meteo weather API, pvlib solar radiation,
  Urban Heat Island effect (Oke 1973).
- Vanos et al. (2023) survivability / liveability limits.

=============================================================================
ADULT MODE
=============================================================================
- Borg RPE scale (6-20), piecewise-linear psychobiological model.
- Adaptation profiles: training and heat acclimatisation affect running
  economy, sweat response, and thirst threshold.
- Ad-libitum drinking strategy.
- CVR module (Lloyd et al. 2022, J Appl Physiol):
  cardiac output, heart rate (CO/SV), CO reserve, decompensation flag.
- Collapse risk model: two-phase logistic function calibrated on observed
    Boston Marathon EHS incidence (Breslow et al. 2021, Am J Sports Med).
    DtD 2024 (50 / 35,000 participants) serves as prospective validation.

=============================================================================
CHILDREN MODE
=============================================================================
- Higher surface-to-mass ratio, lower sweat capacity, higher metabolic cost.
- OMNI RPE scale (0-10).  Blunted thirst response ("voluntary dehydration").
- Simplified fitness factor.

=============================================================================
VERSION HISTORY
=============================================================================
rev01  2025-10-28  Initial combined adult + pediatric version.
rev02  2025-10-28  Advanced RPE models. Full English translation.
rev03  2026-03     CVR module integrated (Lloyd et al. 2022).
                   cardiac_output from JOS-3 used directly as CO demand.
                   HR estimated via CO / SV (Lloyd Eq. 2).
rev04  2026-03     AdultParticipantProfile dataclass replaces anonymous tuple.
                   Fixes critical bug: vo2max and age were swapped in
                   calculate_indices_jos3_adult() due to index confusion.
                   All participant fields now accessed by name, not position.

                     Z = intercept
                         + 1.0 * max(0, T_rect - 39.5)
                         + 4.0 * max(0, T_rect - 40.5)
                         + 0.8 * max(0, 2.0 - CO_reserve)
                         + 0.5 * max(0, dehy_pct - 3.0)
                   Intercept auto-calibrated via Newton iteration to reproduce
                   observed Dam tot Damloop 2024 hospital admission rate

                   Individual collapse probability added to Excel export.
rev07  2026-03     Debug print statements removed.
                   Stale 40.0 deg C comment block removed.

                   English. simulate_runner and calculate_indices_jos3_adult
                   docstrings updated to reflect AdultParticipantProfile.
                   _calculate_threshold_stats: Wald CI documented as known
                   limitation; Clopper-Pearson recommended for tail props.

rev09  2026-04     Monte Carlo distribution corrections (simulate_runner,
                   simulate_child_participant, run_monte_carlo_adult):
                   1. MET loc corrected to 0.0 (was -training_factor*met*0.15).
                      Training effect now applied as separate deterministic
                      mean shift, eliminating systematic negative bias
                      (empirical mean was -0.75 MET instead of 0.0).
                   2. MET sigma widened: 0.05 -> 0.15 * met_value.
                      Captures running-economy CV (~5-8%, Barnes & Kilding
                      2015) plus pace spread across population (~7-10%).
                   3. MET upper clip added: final_met capped at
                      1.25 * met_value (symmetric with lower bound).
                   4. VO2max loc corrected 45 -> 50 mL/kg/min for
                      recreational runners self-selecting into mass events.
                      Ref: Scharhag-Rosenberger et al. (2010).
                   5. sweat_factor (adults) clipped to [0.4, 1.5].
                   6. Age sigma widened: 10 -> 12 years for better
                      representation of 55-65 age group.
                   7. Height loc corrected: 1.75 -> 1.71 m for 50/50
                      gender-mixed runner population (M~1.78, V~1.65).
                      Ref: RIVM NL data; Tolfrey & Pilcher (2013).
                   8. Weight scale widened: 10 -> 12 kg; lower clip
                      50 -> 45 kg (accommodates lighter female runners).
                   Known limitation: rejection sampling introduces <0.3
                   MET bias at training_factor=0.5 (bias +0.6 at tf=1.0);
                   scipy.truncnorm recommended for future revision.

rev12  2026-04     THREE-ENDPOINT CALIBRATION ARCHITECTURE (this revision)
                   See detailed entry below.

rev11  2026-04     BOSTON MARATHON REFERENCE CONSOLIDATION (this revision)
                   See detailed entry below.

rev10  2026-04     POPULATION ARCHITECTURE OVERHAUL
                   =================================================
                   Replaces simulate_runner() with generate_base_population(),
                   which implements a causally correct sampling order and
                   eliminates physiologically impossible parameter combinations.

                   KEY CHANGES:
                   A) Sampling order is now causally correct:
                      gender -> age -> VO2max(age,gender) -> height(gender)
                      -> weight(height,gender) -> %VO2max_at_race_pace
                      -> sweat_factor -> thirst_threshold -> perceptual vars
                      This prevents impossible combinations such as a 65-year-
                      old with VO2max=75 or a 105kg runner with VO2max=70.

                   B) MET is no longer sampled as an absolute value.
                      Instead, pct_vo2max (dimensionless, [0.60, 0.92]) is
                      sampled and stored in the population DataFrame.
                      The actual MET for each scenario is computed on-the-fly
                      in calculate_indices_jos3_adult() as:
                        final_met = vo2max * pct_vo2max / VO2MAX_TO_MET_FACTOR
                      This makes it impossible to exceed 100% VO2max by
                      construction (was ~18.7% of population in rev09).

                   C) VO2max is conditioned on age and gender:
                      - Gender effect: females ~10% lower (Cohen's d ~0.8).
                        Ref: Scharhag-Rosenberger et al. (2010).
                      - Age effect: -0.5 mL/kg/min per year after age 35.
                        Ref: Tanaka et al. (2001) J Am Coll Cardiol 37:153.
                      This replaces the flat N(50,10) distribution.

                   D) Fixed seed support: generate_base_population() accepts
                      a random_seed parameter. Using the same seed always
                      produces the same population, making scenario comparisons
                      (e.g. MET 8.3 vs 11.8, DtD 2024 vs 2025) fully
                      reproducible and scientifically valid.

                   E) Population persistence: the generated population can be
                      saved to / loaded from a .pkl file, so it need not be
                      regenerated for each simulation run. This eliminates the
                      rejection-sampling bias noted in rev09 and reduces
                      run-to-run stochastic variance in scenario comparisons.

                   F) NEW: validate_population() function checks:
                      1. Marginal distributions vs. empirical references
                         (Scharhag-Rosenberger 2010, Tanda & Knechtle 2013,
                          RunRepeat European marathon statistics 2023).
                      2. Correlation matrix vs. physiologically expected values
                         (VO2max-age: r~-0.40; VO2max-gender: Cohen's d~0.80).
                      3. Implied finish-time distribution vs. Amsterdam/
                         Rotterdam marathon results using Daniels & Gilbert
                         (1979) VO2max-performance formula. If the simulated
                         median finish time falls outside [3h30m, 4h30m] for
                         a recreational marathon field, a warning is issued.

                   G) AdultParticipantProfile dataclass extended:
                      - pct_vo2max field added (replaces met_variation).
                      - met_variation field REMOVED to prevent accidental use.
                      NOTE: met_variation in the stored DataFrame column is
                      retained as a computed diagnostic only (never sampled).

                   BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
                   - run_monte_carlo_adult() now accepts an optional
                     base_population argument (DataFrame from
                     generate_base_population()). If None, a fresh population
                     is generated. Existing call sites are unchanged.
                   - All downstream code (CVR, collapse risk, Excel export)
                     is unchanged; only the population generation pathway
                     and the MET computation in calculate_indices_jos3_adult
                     are affected.

                   KNOWN REMAINING ISSUES (addressed in rev11):
                   - training_offset duplication: see rev11 notes below.
                   - intercept_kal calibration source: see rev11 notes below.
                   - scipy.truncnorm not yet used for pct_vo2max; simple
                     np.clip is applied. Tail behavior acceptable for
                     recreational marathon population (deferred to rev12).

=============================================================================
rev11  2026-04     BOSTON MARATHON REFERENCE CONSOLIDATION
=============================================================================
                   This revision makes the Boston Marathon the single
                   authoritative calibration reference for the collapse risk
                   model, resolves the training_factor double-correction
                   ambiguity, cleans up BMI filter logic, and adds population
                   file version-safety.

                   A) CALIBRATION SOURCE -- Boston Marathon (Breslow 2021)
                   ---------------------------------------------------------
                   Previous revisions mixed DtD 2024 and Boston 2017 data
                   in different parts of the code, creating inconsistency.
                   Rev11 consolidates on the Boston Marathon as the primary
                   reference because it is the best-documented mass running
                   event in the peer-reviewed literature for EHS incidence.

                   Reference: Breslow RG et al. (2021) Am J Sports Med 49(10).
                   Dataset: Boston Marathon 2012--2019 (8 editions).
                   Observed EHS rate: approximately 9.0 per 10,000 finishers
                   (pooled across 8 editions, varying by year and temperature).
                   Conservative reference year chosen: 2017 (cool conditions,
                   low incidence) gives a lower-bound intercept; 2012 (warm
                   conditions) gives an upper bound.

                   Calibration anchor used here (rev11):
                     N_OBS_COLLAPSE_ADMISSIONS = 9.0   (per 10,000; pooled)
                     N_OBS_PARTICIPANTS        = 10_000
                     P_OBS_COLLAPSE            = 9.0 / 10_000 = 0.00090

                   intercept_kal recalibrated to: -10.071
                   (Newton iteration, see MODULE_CALIBRATION_NOTES below)

                   All DtD 2024 references in module-level comments have been
                   updated. DtD 2024 (50 / 35,000 = 0.00143) will serve as a
                   prospective validation point once the training_offset
                   calibration is settled (Bongers data needed).

                   B) TRAINING_FACTOR DOUBLE-CORRECTION -- RESOLVED
                   -------------------------------------------------
                   Rev10 applied training_factor in two places:
                     1. generate_base_population(): mu of pct_vo2max shifted
                        down by training_factor * 0.08 (population sampling).
                     2. calculate_indices_jos3_adult(): MET further reduced by
                        training_factor * base_met * 0.15 (economy offset).

                   This caused a compounded reduction in effective %VO2max for
                   trained runners. Quantified effect at tf=1.0:
                     Step 1 alone: mu_pct = 0.80 - 0.08 = 0.72 VO2max
                     Step 2 alone: MET *= (1 - 0.15) -> effective pct = 0.72
                     Combined:     effective pct = 0.72 * 0.85 = 0.61 VO2max

                   At 0.61 VO2max for a tf=1.0 runner the simulated effort is
                   physiologically inconsistent with a competitive marathon
                   pace (literature: elite runners sustain ~85-90% VO2max).

                   RESOLUTION (rev11):
                   The step-2 training_offset in calculate_indices_jos3_adult
                   is RETAINED but its coefficient is reduced from 0.15 to
                   0.05, limiting the economy correction to a 5% MET reduction
                   at tf=1.0. This gives:
                     tf=0.0: effective pct = mu(0.80) * 1.00 = 0.80
                     tf=0.5: effective pct = mu(0.76) * 0.975 = 0.74
                     tf=1.0: effective pct = mu(0.72) * 0.95  = 0.68

                   These values are physiologically defensible for a
                   recreational mass-event population. Clinical calibration
                   from Bongers remains needed for precise coefficient values.
                   The coefficient value (0.05) and its rationale are now
                   explicitly documented at the point of use.

                   C) BMI FILTER LOGIC -- CLARIFIED
                   ----------------------------------
                   In rev10, bmi_target was sampled and then clipped to
                   [18,32] before weight was computed. The subsequent hard
                   rejection `if not (18 <= bmi <= 32): continue` could only
                   be triggered by the weight clip (45--105 kg), not by
                   bmi_target itself. This was a silent logic inconsistency.

                   Rev11: the hard BMI rejection is kept (it correctly catches
                   weight-clip distortions) but is now explicitly commented to
                   explain which path triggers it. The bmi_target clip range
                   is unchanged.

                   D) POPULATION FILE VERSION SAFETY
                   -----------------------------------
                   save_population() now saves a dict with keys:
                     'hestia_version': 'rev11'
                     'population':     list of AdultParticipantProfile
                   load_population() checks the version key and warns if the
                   file was created by a different revision. Backward-
                   compatible: files without a version key are loaded with a
                   deprecation warning.

                   E) MODULE-LEVEL DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY
                   ------------------------------------------
                   All references to DtD 2024 as the *calibration* source
                   have been replaced by Boston Marathon (Breslow 2021).
                   DtD 2024 is now correctly described as a *validation* target.
                   The module docstring, collapse-risk comments, and the main()
                   startup banner are updated to reflect rev11.

                   KNOWN REMAINING ISSUES (to be addressed in rev12):
                   - training_offset coefficient (0.05) requires clinical
                     calibration. Bongers (Radboudumc) data needed.
                   - intercept_kal = -10.071 requires recalibration against
                     DtD 2024 after training_offset is clinically settled.
                   - scipy.truncnorm not yet used for pct_vo2max (np.clip
                     remains; tail bias <0.3 pct-point, acceptable for now).

MODULE_CALIBRATION_NOTES (rev11)
=================================
Boston Marathon pooled EHS rate: 9.0 / 10,000 = 0.00090 (Breslow 2021).
Collapse risk model:
  Z = intercept_kal
      + 1.0 * max(0, T_rect - 39.5)
      + 4.0 * max(0, T_rect - 40.5)
      + 0.8 * max(0, 2.0 - CO_reserve)
      + 0.5 * max(0, dehy_pct - 3.0)

For a population running under Boston-typical conditions (T_rect ~38.8 mean,
CO_reserve ~2.5 mean, dehy ~2% mean), the dominant term is the intercept.
Newton iteration was run offline to find intercept_kal such that the mean
p_collapse across a standard N=5000 population equals 0.00090.
Result: intercept_kal = -10.071

rev12  2026-04     THREE-ENDPOINT CALIBRATION ARCHITECTURE
=============================================================================
                   A) ENDPOINT MISMATCH RESOLVED
                   --------------------------------
                   Rev11 calibrated the collapse model against the Boston EHS
                   rate (9/10,000, Breslow 2021). But the collapse model
                   measures a COMPOSITE endpoint that is broader than
                   clinical EHS:
                     - the T_rect > 39.5 degC term also catches sub-clinical
                       cases
                     - the CO_reserve term adds cardiovascular collapse that
                       is independent of core temperature
                     - the dehydration term catches incidents without
                       hyperthermia

                   The composite endpoint is therefore closer to "all
                   heat-related medical incidents" than to "EHS alone".
                   EHS is empirically ~10-20% of all heat incidents at
                   marathons (Ronneberg et al. 2021, Br J Sports Med).

                   B) THREE-TIER INTERCEPT TABLE
                   --------------------------------
                   Rev12 introduces COLLAPSE_ENDPOINTS: a table of three
                   calibrated intercepts, each for a different endpoint.
                   The active intercept is chosen via ACTIVE_ENDPOINT.

                   Endpoint 1 -- EHS (clinical)
                     Definition : T_rect >= 40.0 degC + CNS dysfunction
                     Source     : Breslow RG et al. (2021) Am J Sports Med
                                  Boston Marathon 2012-2019, pooled
                     P_obs      : 9.0 / 10,000 = 0.00090
                     intercept  : -10.071  (Newton, JOS-3 calibrated, rev11)

                   Endpoint 2 -- Hospital admission
                     Definition : Medical admission after the race (EHS +
                                  severe exhaustion + cardiovascular incidents)
                     Source     : GHOR Noord-Holland Noord, DtD 2024
                                  50 admissions / 35,000 participants
                     P_obs      : 50 / 35,000 = 0.00143 (14.3 / 10,000)
                     intercept  : -9.569  (see INTERCEPT_DERIVATION_NOTES rev12)
                     Status     : PROVISIONAL -- requires recalibration after
                                  clinical validation of training_offset (Bongers)

                   Endpoint 3 -- First-aid contact (all incidents)
                     Definition : Any contact with on-site medical staff,
                                  including mild hyperthermia, exhaustion,
                                  cramps, hyponatremia
                     Source     : Estimate based on DtD 2024 GHOR data
                                  (unpublished); assumes ~3x hospital admission
                     P_obs      : ~150 / 35,000 = 0.00429 (42.9 / 10,000)
                     intercept  : -8.364  (see INTERCEPT_DERIVATION_NOTES rev12)
                     Status     : PROVISIONAL -- wide uncertainty on P_obs
                                  (sensitivity analysis: range -7.40 to -8.40
                                  for 100-250 first-aid contacts / 35,000)

                   C) INTERCEPT_DERIVATION_NOTES (rev12)
                   ----------------------------------------
                   The intercepts for endpoints 2 and 3 were derived via
                   Newton iteration on the analytical population
                   distributions (N=50,000, see intercept_estimation.py).
                   The analytical approximation gives T_rect P50 ~39.1 degC,
                   whereas JOS-3 gives P50 ~38.5 degC under moderate heat.
                   This introduces a systematic shift of ~1.9 units in
                   the intercept.

                   Correction procedure:
                     analytical_intercept(EP1) = -8.160
                     JOS3_intercept(EP1)       = -10.071  (rev11, validated)
                     correction                = -10.071 - (-8.160) = -1.911

                   Corrected intercepts:
                     EP2 (hospital admission): -7.657 + (-1.911) = -9.568 ~= -9.569
                     EP3 (first-aid contact):  -6.453 + (-1.911) = -8.364 ~= -8.364
                     EP3 sensitivity range:    -8.81 to -7.81

                   VALIDATION STATUS:
                     EP1: validated against Boston (Breslow 2021)
                     EP2: provisional -- DtD 2024 is the validation target
                          once training_offset is clinically calibrated (Bongers)
                     EP3: provisional -- P_obs requires unpublished DtD data
                          (to be requested from Connie van der Lee / GHOR NHN)

                   D) ACTIVE_ENDPOINT CONFIGURATION
                   ----------------------------------
                   Default active: 'ehs' (most conservative, best documented)
                   Change via the ACTIVE_ENDPOINT constant or via the
                   user prompt in main() (new prompt added).

                   E) OUTPUT LABELLING
                   --------------------
                   The stats dict and Excel export now contain:
                     'active_endpoint':       str  (name of the active endpoint)
                     'active_endpoint_p_obs': float (calibrated P_obs)
                     'active_intercept_kal':  float
                   so reports are always traceable back to the endpoint.

                   KNOWN REMAINING ISSUES (rev13):
                   - the training_offset coefficient (0.05) requires clinical
                     calibration. Bongers (Radboudumc) data needed.
                   - EP2 and EP3 intercepts require recalibration via direct
                     JOS-3 Newton iteration (instead of the analytical
                     correction) once DtD first-aid counts are available.
                   - causal conditioning of pct_vo2max on pace (rev12 analysis)
                     is planned for rev13.
                   - scipy.truncnorm for pct_vo2max (deferred, rev13).

rev17  2026-05     THERMOREGULATORY CONTROL FAILURE MODULE
=============================================================================
                   Adds optional Thermoregulatory Control Failure (TCF)
                   analysis via HESTIA_ControlFailure_Module.py.

                   The new Thermal-CVR deficit dose is:
                     integral max(0, T_rect - 40.5) *
                              max(0, -CO_reserve) dt

                   Units: deg C * L/min * min = deg C * L.

                   This is explicitly an experimental mechanistic marker for
                   loss of thermoregulatory control reserve. It is not a
                   clinical EHS diagnosis and must be calibrated against event
                   medical data before conversion to EHS probability.

=============================================================================
rev16  2026-05     VULNERABLE T_RECT TAIL PLOTTING
=============================================================================
                   Adds explicit handling of the upper 2.5% T_rect tail.
                   The vulnerable cohort is defined by each participant's
                   personal peak T_rect across the whole event, not by the
                   highest values at each time point. This keeps the plotted
                   line tied to the same high-risk runners over time.

                   Adult output now includes:
                   - P97.5 and P99 T_rect reference curves in the plot.
                   - Mean trajectory of the fixed top-2.5% vulnerable cohort.
                   - Console summary of cohort size, peak cutoff, age, VO2max,
                     K_p, NSAID prevalence, CO reserve, and dehydration.
                   - Excel export flags for participants in the vulnerable
                     top-2.5% cohort.

rev15  2026-05     CALIBRATION UNCERTAINTY BANDS
=============================================================================
                   PROBLEM (rev14 and earlier):
                   Percentage outputs such as pct_decompensation,
                   pct_roberts_kritiek, pct_ehs_postfinish, and
                   pct_kp_onder_002 were reported as single point estimates.
                   The existing Wald CI in _calculate_threshold_stats covers
                   only Monte Carlo sampling variance (~±0.5 pct-point at
                   N=5000) and conveys a false sense of precision: the
                   dominant uncertainty is calibration transfer, not N.

                   Specifically:
                   1. intercept_kal was derived via Newton iteration on a
                      single reference dataset (Boston Marathon pooled,
                      Breslow 2021). The transfer to DtD conditions
                      introduces a systematic uncertainty estimated at ±0.5
                      in log-odds units (conservative; based on between-event
                      EHS rate variation in the literature).
                   2. The Z-function coefficients (W_T1=1.0, W_T2=4.0,
                      W_C=0.8, W_D=0.5) are expert judgement values, not
                      regression estimates. No confidence interval exists for
                      these parameters pending Bongers (Radboudumc) clinical
                      calibration data.

                   SOLUTION (rev15):
                   A) _intercept_sensitivity(z_zonder_intercept, n_sim,
                      intercept_nominal, delta=0.5) computes each key
                      percentage at intercept_kal ± delta (default ±0.5).
                      This gives a calibration uncertainty band that
                      dominates the Wald MC-band at all realistic N.

                   B) _format_pct_with_band(value, lo, hi) formats output as
                      "X.X% (~Y.Y–Z.Z%)" where the tilde signals that the
                      band reflects model calibration uncertainty, not a
                      classical 95% CI.

                   C) GHOR-output (print statements in main()) is updated for
                      pct_decompensation, pct_roberts_kritiek,
                      pct_ehs_postfinish, pct_kp_onder_002, and
                      p_collapse_mean to use _format_pct_with_band().
                      The Wald MC-CI from _calculate_threshold_stats is
                      retained unchanged (it is scientifically correct for
                      its purpose -- temperature threshold statistics).

                   D) stats dict is extended with sensitivity band fields:
                      'pct_decompensation_lo', 'pct_decompensation_hi'
                      'pct_roberts_kritiek_lo', 'pct_roberts_kritiek_hi'
                      'pct_ehs_postfinish_lo', 'pct_ehs_postfinish_hi'
                      'p_collapse_mean_lo', 'p_collapse_mean_hi'
                      These are available for downstream reporting and Excel
                      export without requiring a re-run.

                   EPISTEMOLOGICAL NOTE (for GHOR and Bongers reports):
                   The band "~Y–Z%" does NOT imply a 95% CI.  It means:
                   "if the calibration intercept shifts by ±0.5 log-odds
                   (a plausible range given the Boston→DtD transfer), the
                   model output moves between Y% and Z%."  The Bongers
                   clinical dataset will reduce this band by constraining the
                   Z-function coefficients directly.

rev14  2026-04     THREE OPERATIONAL RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS
=============================================================================
                   Addresses the three structural reliability risks identified
                   in the GHOR-readiness analysis (Apr-2026):

                   A) K_p AS POPULATION VARIABLE  [reliability risk 3]
                   ---------------------------------------------------
                   PROBLEM (rev13 and earlier):
                   The pacing gain K_P_PACING = 0.10 MET/°C was a fixed
                   constant identical for all participants. The interoception
                   literature (Flouris 2024) shows that ~5-10% of endurance
                   athletes have near-zero pacing response to thermal overload
                   due to low interoceptive awareness and/or high motivation.
                   These participants continue at race pace while T_rect
                   escalates -- they are the highest EHS risk group but were
                   indistinguishable from the average population in rev13.
                   Additionally, NSAID use (~25% prevalence in recreational
                   runners) further reduces effective K_p via PGE2 suppression
                   in the brain (Garcia et al. 2019).

                   SOLUTION (rev14):
                   kp_pacing is now a per-participant field in
                   AdultParticipantProfile, sampled from:
                     kp_base ~ N(0.10, 0.04), clipped [0.00, 0.25]
                   NSAID modifier applied to 25% of population:
                     kp_pacing = kp_base * 0.5  (PGE2 suppression)
                   nsaid_gebruik (bool) stored in profile for export.
                   kp_pacing replaces the module constant K_P_PACING in
                   calculate_indices_jos3_adult().
                   The K_P_PACING constant is retained as the population
                   mean reference for documentation purposes.

                   CONSEQUENCE: intercept_kal must be recalibrated after

                   -----------------------------------------------------------
                   PROBLEM (rev13):
                   AUC_thermisch used a 39.0 deg C integration floor.
                   Roberts (Sports Medicine 2007) defines the clinical
                   intervention target as keeping the area under the
                   temperature-time curve above 40.5 deg C below 60
                   degree-minutes. The 39.0 deg C AUC is not a validated
                   clinical metric.

                   SOLUTION (rev14):
                   A second AUC accumulator is added:
                     AUC_klinisch += max(0, T_rect - 40.5) * dt_min
                   Clinical threshold: AUC_klinisch > 60 deg-min (Roberts)
                   Both AUCs are stored in results and exported.
                   GHOR output now includes:
                     - auc_klinisch_p95 (population P95)
                     - pct_roberts_kritiek (% with AUC_klinisch > 60)

                   C) POST-FINISH MODULE  [reliability risk 2]
                   -------------------------------------------
                   PROBLEM (rev13 and earlier):
                   Simulation stopped at the finish line. Clinical and
                   epidemiological evidence shows that 30-40% of EHS cases
                   at mass running events occur in the finish zone, not
                   during the race (Roberts 1998; Rae et al. 2008).
                   Two mechanisms drive post-finish T_rect escalation:
                     1. Metabolic after-glow: residual heat production
                        decays exponentially (tau ~ 2 min, delta ~ 0.4 deg C)
                     2. Venous pooling: muscle pump stops, CO drops acutely,
                        cutaneous heat dissipation falls
                   The pacing controller (K_p) is no longer active post-finish.
                   This creates an open-loop instability that HESTIA did not
                   model.

                   SOLUTION (rev14):
                   simulate_post_finish() propagates T_rect and CO_reserve
                   for 10 minutes after the race ends, without pacing control.
                   Called from calculate_indices_jos3_adult() after the main
                   loop. Returns:
                     t_rect_piek_postfinish   : peak T_rect in finish zone
                     co_reserve_postfinish    : CO_reserve at finish + 10 min
                     auc_klinisch_postfinish  : additional AUC_klinisch
                     ehs_postfinish           : bool -- EHS criterion met
                     t_ehs_postfinish_min     : minutes post-finish at EHS
                   Population aggregate: pct_ehs_postfinish added to stats.
                   GHOR output includes separate finish-zone risk estimate.

                   RECALIBRATION REQUIREMENT
                   --------------------------
                   All three changes shift the T_rect distribution.
                   intercept_kal is marked REQUIRES_RECALIBRATION.
                   Recommended: run intercept_estimation.py with

# Vertosick's 2016 study of 2,303 recreational runners found Riegel's

# of runners -- recreational marathon slowdown is empirically larger than

def compute_relative_wind(v_ambient: float, v_running: float, angle_rad: float) -> float:
    """
    Relative ("apparent") wind speed experienced by a moving runner.

    [2026-07] Previously HESTIA fed JOS-3 ambient wind alone
    (max(0.1, wind_1_5m)), discarding the runner's own forward speed
    entirely -- select_met_activity() computed it but the caller threw it
    away (`_`). Verified this created a large, direction-dependent
    asymmetry between calm-wind and windy race days (Falmouth 2003 vs.
    2015): with ambient wind alone, JOS-3's convective coefficient
    differed by ~47% between the two days; once the runner's own speed is
    included, that gap narrows to 8-19% depending on assumed wind
    direction, more consistent with the two days' documented relative
    EHS severity.

    Direction is not tracked anywhere in this pipeline (no wind-direction
    field is fetched by Thermopoulos_Data_Engine.py, and course heading
    is not modelled) -- so the true headwind/tailwind component for a
    specific participant on a specific day is fundamentally unknown here.
    Rather than pick one deterministic assumption (which can flip the
    sign of a comparison -- verified: assuming a pure tailwind for both
    2003 and 2015 reverses which day looks worse relative to assuming a
    pure headwind), each participant is given their own sampled relative
    angle (AdultParticipantProfile.wind_angle_rad, Uniform[0, 2*pi)), and
    the full law-of-cosines apparent-wind formula is used:

        v_rel = sqrt(v_run^2 + v_wind^2 - 2*v_run*v_wind*cos(angle))

    This is standard sailing/aerodynamics practice (see e.g. the Pugh
    1971 / Davies 1980 treadmill-in-wind-tunnel running studies, which
    established that a runner's own forward motion generates a
    self-induced relative airflow even in still air, and that the true
    relative airflow for a moving body in wind is the vector combination
    of the two). Averaged over a Uniform[0, 2*pi) angle, E[v_rel^2] =
    v_run^2 + v_wind^2 exactly (since E[cos(angle)] = 0), so the
    population mean recovers the simpler Pythagorean estimate used
    during initial testing, while individual participants now span the
    full headwind-to-tailwind range -- representing the real uncertainty
    as population spread instead of a single, arbitrarily chosen point
    estimate. This also matches Air speed and direction affect metabolic
    and thermoregulatory responses during walking and running (J Appl
    Physiol, 2024), which found wind-direction effects on metabolic cost
    fall within ordinary inter-individual variation below ~4 m/s ambient
    wind -- exactly the regime both Falmouth race days are in.

    Caveat carried over from that same paper: the asymmetry Davies (1980)
    found between headwind cost and tailwind benefit applies to
    aerodynamic drag (which scales with v^2); it has NOT been separately
    established for JOS-3's convective heat transfer coefficient (which
    scales with v^0.62) -- so no such asymmetry correction is applied
    here beyond what the law-of-cosines formula itself gives.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v_ambient : float
        Ambient wind speed at body height (m/s), e.g. wind_1_5m.
    v_running : float
        The participant's own forward speed (m/s).
    angle_rad : float
        Angle between the ambient wind direction and the participant's
        heading (radians). 0 = pure tailwind, pi = pure headwind.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Relative (apparent) wind speed (m/s), floored at 0.1 for
        numerical safety (matches the previous minimum floor).

#  DESIGN RATIONALE
#  ----------------
#  The previous simulate_runner() sampled VO2max and MET independently, which
#  produced physiologically impossible combinations: a runner with VO2max=25
#  assigned a MET implying 120% VO2max. About 18.7% of the simulated
#  population exceeded 100% VO2max (identified in rev09 analysis).
#
#  The new generate_base_population() uses a CAUSAL SAMPLING ORDER:
#
#    Step 1  gender          -- independent; 58% male / 42% female
#                              (Western-European major running events, RunRepeat 2023)
#    Step 2  age             -- N(40, 10), clipped [18, 65]
#                              (median age of recreational marathon runners, NL)
#    Step 3  VO2max          -- conditioned on age AND gender
#                              Base values: male N(52,8), female N(44,7)
#                              Age correction: -0.5 mL/kg/min per year > 35
#                              Ref: Scharhag-Rosenberger (2010); Tanaka (2001)
#    Step 4  height          -- conditioned on gender
#                              male N(1.78, 0.07), female N(1.65, 0.06)
#                              Ref: RIVM NL anthropometric data
#    Step 5  weight          -- conditioned on height + gender
#                              BMI filter [18.0, 32.0] active
#                              Ref: Tanda & Knechtle (2013)
#    Step 6  pct_vo2max      -- [rev13] CAUSAL: fraction of VO2max at event pace.
#                              Deterministic via Daniels-Gilbert inversion:
#                                pct = VO2_at_event_pace / vo2max_i + noise(0.04)
#                              Resolves the Pearl causal Markov violation from rev10-rev12.
#                              EVENT_PACE_MIN_PER_KM is the driving parameter.
#    Step 7  sweat_factor    -- conditioned on acclimatization_factor
#    Step 8  thirst_threshold-- conditioned on acclimatization_factor
#    Step 9  temp/rh_var     -- independent (perceptual noise)
#    Step 10 mf_score        -- independent (motivation)
#
#  MET COMPUTATION (on-the-fly, not stored as a population parameter)
#  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#  final_met = vo2max * pct_vo2max / VO2MAX_TO_MET_FACTOR
#
#  This guarantees, by construction, that %VO2max == pct_vo2max (clipped
#  to [0.60, 0.92]), so physiologically impossible combinations cannot
#  occur. training_factor deterministically shifts the mean of pct_vo2max
#  downward (better-trained runners = lower fraction), consistent with
#  the literature (Joyner 1991).
#
#  FIXED SEED SUPPORT
#  ------------------
#  Use random_seed for reproducible scenario comparisons.
#  The same seed always yields the same N runners. Save the population
#  as a .pkl with save_population() for reuse without re-sampling.

    Generate a fixed base population of adult marathon runners for Monte Carlo
    simulation.

    This function replaces simulate_runner() (rev09) with a causally correct
    sampling architecture. See module docstring (rev10) for full design
    rationale.

    The critical difference from rev09 is that MET is NOT sampled here.
    Instead, pct_vo2max (the fraction of VO2max at race pace) is sampled and
    stored. The actual MET is computed on-the-fly in
    calculate_indices_jos3_adult() as:
        final_met = vo2max * pct_vo2max / VO2MAX_TO_MET_FACTOR

    This guarantees that no participant can exceed their own VO2max by
    construction (was ~18.7% of population in rev09 due to independent
    VO2max and MET sampling).

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_simulations : int
        Target number of valid participants to generate.
    training_factor : float in [0.0, 1.0]
        Training status. Shifts mu of pct_vo2max downward (trained runners
        sustain a lower %VO2max at race pace for the same absolute pace).
        Effect: mu_pct -= training_factor * 0.08 (max 8 percentage points).
    acclimatization_factor : float in [0.0, 1.0]
        Heat acclimatization. Shifts sweat_factor up and thirst_threshold down.
    random_seed : int or None
        If provided, np.random and random are seeded before sampling.
        Use the same seed for reproducible scenario comparisons.
    met_value : float or None
        [suite-integration fix] The absolute MET of the chosen activity
        (e.g. 3.5 for a moderate walk, 8.3 for recreational running -- see
        MET_ACTIVITIES_ADULT). When given, each participant's %VO2max is
        derived from THIS activity's VO2 demand relative to their own
        VO2max:
            vo2_at_event_pace = met_value * VO2MAX_TO_MET_FACTOR
            pct_vo2max_det    = vo2_at_event_pace / vo2max
        This makes the population's simulated intensity match whatever
        activity was actually selected (walking, jogging, ...), for any
        `duration_hours`, instead of always assuming a fixed marathon-race
        pace regardless of the chosen activity or event length (the previous
        behaviour, kept below as a fallback when met_value is None).
        [flagged for review] The pct_vo2max clip range below (was [0.55,
        0.95], calibrated for marathon-race effort) is widened to [0.15,
        0.95] so that light activities (e.g. walking) aren't artificially
        floored into a marathon-race effort band. This widening is an
        engineering consequence of generalising the same mechanism beyond
        running, not an independently validated number -- please review it,
        Koos, especially the lower bound.
    sample_pace : bool
        [2026-09] When True, each participant gets their OWN pace (via
        sample_recreational_pace_min_per_km(), gender-conditioned) instead
        of the single shared met_value -- their own MET (derived from that
        pace via _acsm_met_from_pace()) and their own duration_hours
        (pace * event_dist_km) follow from it. This is what makes exposure
        DURATION vary with who someone is, not just how hard the shared
        pace feels to them (which pct_vo2max already did on its own).
        When False (default), behaviour is unchanged from before this
        parameter existed: every participant shares met_value, and
        duration_hours is filled with a placeholder (see run_monte_carlo_
        adult(), which only slices interp_data per-person when sample_pace
        was actually used to generate the population).
    event_dist_km : float
        Event distance in km, used only when sample_pace=True to convert
        each participant's own pace into their own duration_hours. Default
        16.1 km (Dam tot Damloop) -- matches Klimatos_ClimateShift.py's and
        run_hestia.py's own EVENT_DIST_KM/event distance default.

    Returns
    -------
    list of AdultParticipantProfile
        Successfully generated profiles (may be fewer than n_simulations
        if BMI filter rejects many candidates; max 30 attempts per profile).

#  POPULATION VALIDATION (rev10 -- NEW)
#
#  validate_population() performs three levels of validation:
#
#  1. MARGINAL VALIDATION
#     Compares distribution statistics (mean, SD, percentiles) of each
#     population parameter against published empirical references.
#     A WARNING is printed for any parameter where the simulated mean
#     deviates by more than 1 SD from the reference value.
#
#  2. CORRELATION VALIDATION
#     Checks physiologically expected correlations in the generated population:
#       - VO2max vs age:    expected r in [-0.50, -0.25]
#       - VO2max vs gender: expected Cohen's d in [0.70, 1.00]
#         (coded as 0/1 for female/male)
#     Values outside these ranges trigger a WARNING.
#
#  3. FINISH-TIME VALIDATION (afgeleide validatie)
#     Uses the Daniels & Gilbert (1979) VO2max-performance formula to compute
#     an implied marathon finish time for each participant based on their
#     VO2max and pct_vo2max. The population finish-time distribution is then
#     compared to the reference range for a recreational Dutch marathon field:
#       - Median finish time: expected [3h30m, 4h30m]
#       - P5 (fast tail):     expected [2h45m, 3h30m]
#       - P95 (slow tail):    expected [4h30m, 5h30m]
#     This is the strongest test: if the simulated population finishes
#     collectively in a realistic time range, the joint distribution of
#     VO2max, %VO2max, and age is empirically anchored.
#
#  OUTPUT
#     A summary table is printed to console and a 3-panel validation figure
#     is displayed (marginals + correlation matrix + finish-time histogram).

    Borg 6-20 RPE for adults.

    [2026-07, REBUILT] Previously a piecewise-linear function of ABSOLUTE
    MET alone (unchanged from rev09) -- found via an unrelated
    investigation (why % first-aid-contact was implausibly high for a
    marathon) that this was inconsistent with how the rest of this model
    treats effort: `AdultParticipantProfile.pct_vo2max` (the rev13 "causal"
    MET assignment) already exists specifically because *relative*
    intensity, not absolute MET, is what should drive individual response
    -- two people at the same absolute MET but very different fitness do
    not find it equally hard. The old RPE formula ignored pct_vo2max
    entirely and used only a flat, fitness-independent `training_factor`
    discount on top of absolute MET.

    Checked whether this was already implicitly handled by cross-checking
    RPE against this model's own independently-computed heart rate
    (Borg's own design principle: RPE*10 approx. HR in bpm). Population-
    pooled correlation was misleadingly near zero (0.066, diluted by
    between-person differences in baseline fitness); the more meaningful
    within-participant correlation over time was strong (median 0.913,
    100% of participants >0.7) -- so the OLD formula's time-course
    behaviour was not broken. The absolute-MET-vs-relative-intensity gap
    was a separate, valid structural point, not evidence the old formula
    was wrong in itself.

    New formula, grounded in two established equations rather than
    hand-tuned breakpoints:
        %HRmax = 0.64 * %VO2max + 37        (Swain DP et al., 1994,

                                              same formula already used in

        RPE (Borg 6-20) approx. HR / 10      (Borg's own original scale
                                              design principle)
    combined: base_rpe = (0.64*pct_vo2max*100 + 37) / 100 * HR_max / 10

#  CHANGE SUMMARY vs rev12
#  -----------------------
#  [rev13-P4] Dynamic pacing: current_met is updated each time step based on
#  the previous T_rect (closed pacing loop). The open-loop constant-MET
#  assumption is replaced by a proportional controller:
#
#    thermal_overshoot  = max(0, T_rect[t-1] - T_RECT_PACING_THRESHOLD)
#    met_reduction      = K_P_PACING * thermal_overshoot
#    current_met[t]     = max(1.5, met_initial - training_offset - met_reduction)
#
#  met_initial = base_met_from_vo2max (unchanged from rev12 pre-loop computation)
#  training_offset = training_factor * base_met_from_vo2max * 0.05 (rev11, unchanged)
#  K_P_PACING = 0.10 MET/°C (Ely BR et al. 2010, Med Sci Sports Exerc 42(1):135-141; module constant)
#  T_RECT_PACING_THRESHOLD = 38.5°C (module constant)
#
#  The training_offset represents running economy and is kept outside the
#  thermal feedback term -- economy and voluntary pacing are orthogonal.
#  current_met is stored per time step in results for diagnostics.
#
#  [rev13-P5] AUC_thermisch: cumulative integral of T_rect > 39.0°C (°C·min)
#  is accumulated in the loop and stored in results. This implements
#  Breslow's time-integrated thermal dose concept. T_AUC_THRESHOLD = 39.0°C
#  (module constant).
#
#  CHANGE SUMMARY vs rev09-rev12 (retained from earlier revisions)
#  ----------------------------------------------------------------
#  The met_variation field has been removed from AdultParticipantProfile.
#  MET is now computed from VO2max and pct_vo2max:
#
#    base_met_from_vo2max = participant.vo2max * participant.pct_vo2max
#                           / VO2MAX_TO_MET_FACTOR
#
#  A training_factor deterministic shift is then applied  [rev11: REVISED]:
#    training_offset = training_factor * base_met_from_vo2max * 0.05
#    final_met       = base_met_from_vo2max - training_offset
#
#  TRAINING_FACTOR DOUBLE-CORRECTION (rev11 resolution)
#  -----------------------------------------------------
#  Rev10 applied training_factor in two independent places:
#    1. generate_base_population(): mu of pct_vo2max -= training_factor * 0.08
#    2. here: MET further reduced by training_factor * base_met * 0.15
#
#  Combined effect at tf=1.0 was:
#    effective %VO2max = (0.80 - 0.08) * (1 - 0.15) = 0.72 * 0.85 = 0.61
#
#  This is too low for a competitive marathon population. Rev11 reduces the
#  step-2 coefficient from 0.15 to 0.05, giving:
#    tf=0.0: effective pct ≈ 0.80 * 1.00 = 0.80
#    tf=0.5: effective pct ≈ 0.76 * 0.975 = 0.74
#    tf=1.0: effective pct ≈ 0.72 * 0.95  = 0.68
#
#  These values are consistent with the physiological literature for
#  recreational marathon runners (Joyner 1991; Jones & Carter 2000).
#  Clinical calibration from Bongers (Radboudumc) is still needed to
#  determine the precise coefficient value.
#
#  The base_met parameter (user-selected activity MET) is NO LONGER used
#  to drive the individual simulation. It is retained as a reference value
#  for the population mean validation and for the MET threshold analysis
#  (unchanged). Each participant's MET is now fully determined by their
#  own VO2max and pct_vo2max, making cross-scenario comparisons valid.

    Propagate T_rect and CO_reserve for PF_DUUR_MIN minutes after the finish.

    After crossing the finish line:
      1. The pacing controller (K_p) is no longer active -- open loop.
      2. Metabolic after-glow: residual heat production decays exponentially.
         Peak amplitude PF_DELTA_T_NAGLOED, time constant PF_TAU_NAGLOED.
      3. Venous pooling: muscle pump stops abruptly, causing an acute,
         short-lived drop in venous return/CO on top of whatever the
         steady-state cardiovascular balance would otherwise give.
      4. Passive cooling from sweating continues but at reduced rate because
         cutaneous blood flow is compromised by pooling.

    [2026-07, REBUILT] Previously CO_reserve only ever decreased after the
    finish (`co_res -= pooling_rate * dt`, with pooling_rate >= 0 always) --
    mathematically incapable of recovery no matter how long the simulated
    window was (verified: extending the window from 10 to 30 min just
    scaled the reported "duration" proportionally, the signature of
    right-censoring, not a real recovery process). This was inconsistent
    with the same-day CVR rebuild on Lloyd et al. (2022): T_rect declining
    after the finish should let the Cardiac Heat Strain Index (CHSI) fall,
    which raises CO_max back up, and MET dropping to resting level should
    sharply cut CO_demand -- both push CO_reserve to recover, given enough
    time, exactly as it does during a real recovery.

    Fixed by recomputing CO_max/CO_demand at every post-finish step via the
    SAME `CVRModel.compute_step()` used during the race, fed the (already
    computed, unchanged) declining T_rect and a resting MET
    (`PF_MET_RUST`), instead of reading a single value frozen at the finish
    line. The acute venous-pooling term is kept as an *additional*,
    separately-decaying perturbation on top of this recomputed baseline --
    it represents a real, short-lived phenomenon (the muscle pump stopping
    abruptly) distinct from the steady-state cardiovascular rebalancing
    Lloyd's equations describe, and removing it entirely would lose the
    validated acute dip (30.7% of positive-finish-CO_reserve participants
    crossing zero within the window, confirmed against Falmouth 2015 data
    when this term was first added).

    T_skin is not independently modelled post-finish (no detailed model
    available); approximated by holding the T_core-T_skin gap observed at
    the finish line constant as T_core declines. Dehydration is held
    constant post-finish (no further sweat loss modelled).

    EHS criterion post-finish:
        T_rect > 40.5 deg C  AND  CO_reserve <= 0

    Parameters
    ----------

    co_reserve_finish  : float  -- CO_reserve at moment of finishing
    auc_klinisch_race  : float  -- AUC_klinisch accumulated during race
    wbgt_finish        : float  -- WBGT at finish (deg C), used for passive cooling
    co_max_finish      : float, optional -- heat-adjusted CO_max at finish
        (L/min). Drives the *absolute* magnitude of the acute venous-pooling
        perturbation (see PF_POOLING_FRAC_OF_COMAX) -- falls back to a
        population-typical 20.0 L/min if not supplied.
    cvr_model          : CVRModel, optional -- if supplied, CO_max/CO_demand
        are recomputed each step via compute_step(), enabling recovery. If
        None, falls back to the old one-way pooling-only formula (backward
        compatible with any caller that does not have a CVRModel instance).
    t_skin_finish      : float, optional -- mean skin temperature at finish
        (deg C), for the CHSI calculation. Falls back to t_rect_finish - 4.0
        (matches CVRModel.compute_step()'s own fallback) if not supplied.
    dehydration_kg_finish : float -- cumulative body-water loss at finish
        (kg), held constant through the post-finish window.

    Run the core JOS-3 simulation for a single virtual adult participant.

    [rev10] MET computation change:
    MET is no longer taken from participant_params.met_variation (removed).
    Instead it is derived from VO2max and pct_vo2max:
        base_met = vo2max * pct_vo2max / VO2MAX_TO_MET_FACTOR
        final_met = base_met * (1 - training_factor * 0.05)  [rev11: was 0.15]

    [rev11] training_offset coefficient reduced from 0.15 to 0.05.
    See CORE ADULT SIMULATION WORKER block above for full rationale.
    The effective %VO2max at the simulation MET level is now:
        tf=0.0 -> ~0.80; tf=0.5 -> ~0.74; tf=1.0 -> ~0.68.

    The met_value argument is retained for backward compatibility but is
    only used by the liveability check (Vanos et al. 2023), not as the
    individual simulation MET. This is intentional: liveability limits are
    defined for the EVENT pace (user-selected MET), not the individual.

    """
    Estimates the calibration sensitivity band for a binary population
    fraction (e.g. pct_decompensation, pct_roberts_kritiek) that depends
    indirectly on the same Z-logistic threshold.

    Because pct_decompensation and pct_roberts_kritiek are derived from
    physiological thresholds (CO_reserve, AUC_klinisch) that are NOT
    directly controlled by intercept_kal, the intercept sensitivity does
    NOT apply to them.  Their dominant uncertainty is instead the ±0.3°C
    JOS-3 T_rect systematic offset.

    For those metrics we use a different approach: we shift the effective
    T_rect threshold by ±0.3°C and recompute the fraction.  However,
    this requires the raw arrays, which are not all available here.

    As a pragmatic approximation this function propagates the RELATIVE
    sensitivity of the logistic collapse probability to bound the
    physiological fraction:

        relative_sensitivity = (p_hi - p_lo) / p_nominal

    and applies it symmetrically to the flag-based fraction:

        lo = flag_fraction * (1 - relative_sensitivity / 2)
        hi = flag_fraction * (1 + relative_sensitivity / 2)
        (both clipped to [0, 100])

    This is explicitly an approximation.  The band is labelled '~' in
    output to signal model-based rather than statistical uncertainty.

    Manages the entire adult Monte Carlo simulation process.

    [rev10] New parameter: base_population (optional)
    --------------------------------------------------
    If base_population is provided (list of AdultParticipantProfile from
    generate_base_population()), it is used directly without re-sampling.
    This enables reproducible scenario comparisons: the SAME population
    experiences different meteorological conditions or MET values.

    If base_population is None, a fresh population is generated with
    generate_base_population() using the given random_seed.

    The age_configuration parameter is IGNORED when base_population is
    provided (age is already embedded in each profile from rev10 onward).
    A deprecation note is printed if age_configuration != 'standard' and
    a base_population is supplied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interp_data : list of dicts
    lat, lon : float
    met_value : float
        Base MET of the activity (used for liveability check and reference).
    clo_value : float
    n_simulations : int
        Target number of participants. Ignored if base_population is provided.
    age_configuration : str or tuple
        "standard" or (min_age, max_age). Ignored if base_population provided.
    training_factor : float
    acclimatization_factor : float
    use_parallel : bool
    base_population : list of AdultParticipantProfile or None [rev10]
    random_seed : int or None [rev10]
    sample_pace : bool
        [2026-09] When True (and base_population is None, so a fresh
        population is generated here), each participant gets their own
        pace/MET/duration_hours instead of the shared met_value/interp_data
        window -- see generate_base_population()'s sample_pace docstring.
        interp_data must then cover AT LEAST the slowest sampled
        participant's duration; the caller (run_hestia.py's
        monte_carlo_adult()) widens the requested window accordingly before
        calling this function. Each participant's own worker_args slices
        interp_data down to their own duration and uses their own MET, so
        a fast participant does not simply share a longer, slower
        participant's exposure window truncated early -- they get their
        own window from the same start time.
    event_dist_km : float
