PYROX — population group parameters
================================================================================
The 23 population groups, each expressed in the readable parameter names of
pyrox_model.GroupParameters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVIDENCE STATUS — read this before trusting any number
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only THREE groups are specified by the paper (Section 2.3). They are labelled
evidence_status='paper'. The paper itself states their values are "based on
physiological plausibility and literature estimates", NOT direct measurements,
so even these are plausibility estimates, not measured constants.

The other 20 groups are labelled evidence_status='extrapolated'. Their ORDERING
(athletes most resilient, dementia least) is grounded in the heat-vulnerability
literature, but the specific numbers are structured interpolations along the
resilient -> vulnerable axis. They are illustrative, not validated. Do not cite
them as empirical values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CORRECTION TO THE PUBLISHED TABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The paper's Section 2.3 table lists, for young / older / vulnerable:

    max_acclimatization_capacity : 0.25 / 0.45 / 0.80   (ASCENDING with frailty)
    recovery_threshold           : 0.5  / 0.8  / 1.5     (ASCENDING with frailty)
    base_recovery_rate           : 0.30 / 0.18 / 0.12    (DESCENDING with frailty)

For the model to be coherent, every PROTECTIVE parameter must move the same way
along the resilient -> vulnerable axis (a resilient group should be protected on
all fronts at once). base_recovery_rate is already correct: resilient groups
recover fastest. But max_acclimatization_capacity and recovery_threshold both
ASCEND with frailty, i.e. they make the FRAIL group the better-protected one —
which contradicts both physiology and the paper's own Section 4 narrative
("young develops strong acclimatization ... vulnerable shows minimal
acclimatization development").

The fact that base_recovery_rate runs the OPPOSITE way to the other two
protective columns is itself the tell: the two ascending columns were entered in
reversed order. We therefore reverse max_acclimatization_capacity and
recovery_threshold (swap the young and vulnerable entries), leaving
base_recovery_rate and all other published values untouched:

    CORRECTED:
    max_acclimatization_capacity : 0.80 / 0.45 / 0.25
    recovery_threshold           : 1.5  / 0.8  / 0.5
    base_recovery_rate           : 0.30 / 0.18 / 0.12   (unchanged)

After this single correction, all three protective parameters descend together
with frailty, and the Section 4 trajectory ordering (vulnerable strains first,
young stabilises safely) reproduces. Each corrected group is flagged below with
`# CORRECTED`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPOSURE MEMORY KERNEL SHAPES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The paper gives three example kernel shapes. A STEEP kernel weights the most
recent days heavily (fast adaptation, fit physiology); a FLAT kernel spreads
weight evenly and low (slow, weak adaptation). The three prototypes use the
paper's exact shapes; other groups use shapes interpolated on the same axis.

# ---- athletic / elite (extrapolated): strongest protective loops -----------
# ---- checked (eleventh/final deep check, lighter-touch pass) --------------
# Unlike the vulnerable-tier groups above, this checks the resilient/healthy
# end of the roster -- CONFIRMED overall, with two genuine but narrow
# caveats that don't change the numbers but matter for how these groups are
# USED.
# CONFIRMING: elite-sport exertional heat stroke (EHS) incidence is
# empirically low (PMC9826288, 2022 review) -- consistent with these very
# high capacity values (0.95-1.00).
# CAVEAT 1 (about event/intensity choice, not these numbers): EHS risk is
# higher in SHORTER, higher-intensity races (e.g. 10 km) than in marathons,
# because athletes sustain a higher relative intensity for the (shorter)
# duration (PMC9826288). This means pairing "elite_athletes" with a
# high-MET/short-duration event is a materially different (higher) risk
# scenario than pairing it with marathon-pace/duration -- relevant to how
# HESTIA's met_value now actually drives population intensity (see the
# met_value integration fix earlier in this changelog), not something this
# group's own parameters should absorb.
# CAVEAT 2 (a real, narrow, behavioural mechanism no capacity parameter can
# represent): "high levels of motivation and exertion can in some cases
# blunt sensory feedback from hyperthermia that under normal circumstances
# alter behaviour" in elite competitive settings (PMC9826288) -- i.e. elite
# athletes may override the protective urge to slow down under competitive
# drive in a way recreational participants would not. ~85% of endurance-
# event collapses occur AFTER crossing the finish line, most benign
# (postural hypotension from reduced venous return once running stops), a
# minority heat-stroke (Holtzhause & Noakes 1997, cited in GSSI review) --
# consistent with, and an independent validation of, HESTIA's own dedicated
# post-finish TCF module. No number changes made: this is a genuine
# behavioural-override risk, not a capacity deficit, and the group's overall
# very-low-incidence positioning remains well supported.
# [2026-09] RECALIBRATED (thirteenth check in this series). All prior checks
# in this file concluded "no number change" for the athlete-tier groups,
# reasoning from real incidence data that their "very-low-incidence
# positioning remains well supported". A fresh, more targeted literature
# search this session (Périard, DeGroot & Jay 2022, PMC9826288) found this
# was an incomplete reading: exertional heat illness incidence in endurance
# running is 674.0 per 10,000 athlete-exposures -- the HIGHEST of any sport
# studied, not the lowest -- and elite-competition EHS/DNF/medical-encounter
# rates run as high as 118-170 per 1,000 finishers in marathon/race-walk
# events (Breslow et al., cited above). "Very-low-incidence" was true only
# for population-level base rates, not for the athlete-exposure or
# per-finisher rates that actually describe this group's own risk.
#
# Separately, and independently of the epidemiology: capacity=1.00 makes
# net_strain_input's flip point (recovery_threshold / (1-capacity))
# mathematically infinite -- not merely rare, but IMPOSSIBLE at any load,
# on principle. Checked directly against the weather pipeline's own
# heat-load formula (thermopoulos_loader.py, load=(feels_like-22)*0.10):
# even the four next-most-resistant groups (elite/recreational athletes,
# outdoor_workers, and the ordinary adults_18_45 baseline -- see
# TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md Sec 3.3 for the full sorted list) require
# feels-like temperatures of 97-422 degC to ever reach runaway -- for
# comparison, the highest heat index ever confirmed on Earth is 81.1 degC
# (Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 2003; Guinness World Records). These were not
# "hard to reach", they were unreachable by any weather this planet has
# ever produced.
#
# Recalibrated so runaway becomes reachable at genuinely extreme but
# real-world-plausible conditions, while keeping this group the most
# resistant of the four athlete/worker groups (endurance > elite >
# recreational > outdoor_workers, preserving the existing relative
# ordering, which the epidemiology above does still support in relative,
# not absolute, terms -- endurance athletes sustain far higher relative
# effort for far longer than recreational participants, which plausibly
# does earn them the top spot in resistance even though it is what also
# elevates their absolute incidence). Note the simple flip-point formula
# (recovery_threshold/(1-capacity)) is only an approximate guide -- the
# actual transition, verified directly via equilibrium_strain() bisection
# rather than assumed, lands at a somewhat higher load than the formula
# suggests for all four groups in this block (a real, narrow "stable
# accumulation" zone exists between the safe and runaway regimes -- see
# TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md Sec 3.4). Empirically verified after tuning:
# runaway now first reached at a feels-like of 97.0 degC -- still above
# the current confirmed world record (81.1 degC, Dhahran 2003) but far
# closer than the pre-fix literal impossibility, and deliberately left as
# the most extreme of the four (this group's own top-of-taxonomy
# position), not tuned further down; flagged as a judgement call open to
# revision, not a literature-derived value.

# ---- healthy working-age (extrapolated) ------------------------------------
# ---- outdoor_workers (checked, twelfth/final check) -----------------------
# The occupational heat-mortality literature is stark: farm/agricultural
# workers are 35x as likely as the general population to die of heat
# exposure (NEJM 2023, doi:10.1056/NEJMp2307850); construction workers 13x
# (95% CI 10.1-16.7), agriculture/forestry/fishing/hunting 35x (95% CI
# 26.3-47.0) vs. the all-other-industries average, per US OSHA rulemaking
# citing Gubernot et al. 2015 (Federal Register 2021-23250).
# CRITICAL POPULATION-MATCH CAVEAT: these mortality multipliers are
# overwhelmingly driven by UNACCLIMATIZED, inadequately protected workers --
# migrant and ethnic-minority outdoor workers face disproportionate risk,
# often without adequate water/shade/rest provisions (PMC11930879 scoping
# review). This PYROX group is explicitly labelled "(heat-exposed,
# ACCLIMATIZED)" -- a narrower, better-protected reference population than
# the raw occupational mortality statistics describe. Applying the 13-35x
# multipliers directly to this specific group would be a population
# mismatch. Acclimatization itself takes "at least four days" to begin
# (occupational heat-strain meta-analysis, doi:10.1080/23328940.2022.2030634)
# -- broadly consistent with, though a shorter minimum-onset estimate than,
# the 7-14-day full-acclimatization window used for unacclimatized_travelers
# above.
# [flagged for review] No number change made: the existing capacity (0.80,
# reasonably below the athlete tier but above indoor_workers) is defensible
# specifically for the ACCLIMATIZED, adequately-protected worker this group
# is labelled to represent. If PYROX or HESTIA ever needs to model the
# broader, mixed outdoor labour workforce (including unacclimatized/
# inadequately-protected workers) as its own category, that would warrant a
# substantially more severe, SEPARATE group informed by the 13-35x mortality
# multipliers above -- not a correction to this one.

    # heat). But combined with recovery_threshold=1.70, it gave a flip

# KEY FINDING -- this group needed a different kind of correction than
# obesity/cardiovascular_disease/medication_impaired: those are permanent
# impairments to the CEILING of protection. Lack of acclimatization is a
# TEMPORARY, fully recoverable state -- the consistent finding across CDC,
# occupational-health and sports-medicine sources is that most heat
# acclimatization completes within 7-14 days of regular heat exposure
# (cardiovascular adaptations within the first week; sweating adaptations
# needing the full 10-14 days), reaching the SAME normal ceiling as anyone
# else of similar fitness -- not a permanently lower one (CDC NIOSH,
# https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/heat-stress/recommendations/acclimatization.html;
# ScienceDirect Heat Acclimatization overview, ref. Sawka et al.; Racinais
# et al. 2015 consensus statement on training/competing in the heat,
# doi:10.1007/s40279-015-0343-6, which explicitly flags unacclimatized
# participants in mass-participation events -- this project's own use case --
# as a population event organizers should specifically address).
# max_acclimatization_capacity was therefore UNDER-representing this group:
# the vulnerability is the SLOW START, which this group's exposure_memory
# kernel already models correctly (a zero-weighted ramp -- "no prior
# exposure" -- rather than the linear/flat kernels used elsewhere). Capping
# the ceiling too, on top of the slow start, double-penalises a condition
# that literature shows resolves to normal within about two weeks.
# Also quantified: fit individuals acclimatize ~50% faster than unfit ones
# (California DIR heat illness prevention guidance), and during moderate/
# heavy work, VO2max thresholds of 30/36.5 mL/kg/min respectively predict
# who runs a higher core temperature while unacclimatized (Notley et al.,
# Frontiers in Physiology 2020, doi:10.3389/fphys.2020.541483) -- consistent
# with this being about SPEED and FITNESS-INTERACTION rather than a capped
# ceiling.

# MECHANISM: the best-controlled comparisons (mass-matched for total body
# mass AND fitness, isolating adiposity itself) show sweating rate and
# cutaneous vasodilation are essentially NORMAL in high-body-fat individuals
# -- the sudomotor/vasomotor effector systems are not "broken" by adiposity
# per se (Cramer & Jay 2015/2016, J Appl Physiol, mass-matched: LO-BF 10.8%
# vs HI-BF 32.0%, doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00906.2015). The dominant
# mechanism is instead BIOPHYSICAL/GEOMETRIC: a lower body-surface-area-to-
# mass ratio in higher-adiposity individuals means less relative surface for
# evaporative heat loss per unit of heat produced -- "for the same heat load
# per unit body weight, the increase in tissue temperature will be greater
# in an obese than in a lean person" (Kenney 1985, cited in Chiang et al.
# 2024, doi:10.1016/j.puhe.2023.11.008). At a FIXED ABSOLUTE heat production,
# mass-matched HI-BF participants showed ~32% greater core-temperature rise
# than LO-BF (ΔTre 0.87 vs 0.66 °C over 60 min; Cramer & Jay 2016,
# doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00768.2016). An unmatched systematic review/
# meta-analysis (10 studies, n=211, high-BF 36.7±11.8% vs low-BF 17.8±5.7%)
# found the same direction, though several included studies did not control
# for the mass/fitness confound (Wickham et al. 2021, J Sci Med Sport,
# doi:10.1016/j.jsams.2021.06.004).
#
# A separate, smaller pilot study on 6-week heat-acclimation TRAINING
# specifically in overweight/obese participants found suggestive (not
# definitive -- n=8, pilot-level) evidence that the ADAPTATION PROCESS itself
# is slower during the initial weeks, attributed to elevated adiposity
# impairing core-to-skin conductive heat exchange (Faulkner et al. 2015,
# doi:10.1186/2046-7648-4-S1-A115).
#
# CALIBRATION: recovery_threshold lowered (0.80 -> 0.75) and
# max_acclimatization_capacity lowered slightly (0.42 -> 0.40) to reflect
# this reduced heat-dissipation margin and the suggestive slowed-adaptation
# finding; exposure memory flattened (MEMORY_FLAT -> MEMORY_VERY_FLAT) for

# MECHANISM, more direct than obesity's: during heat stress, cardiac output
# must rise substantially to simultaneously perfuse the skin (up to 50-70% of
# resting CO, ~8 L/min) AND working muscle/vital organs -- up to ~13 L/min in
# healthy adults (Kenney et al. 2004, Circulation, doi:10.1161/
# CIRCULATIONAHA.105.540773, congestive heart failure patients). In CHF,
# cardiac output still rises but the increase "may be lower than that
# required to adequately perfuse the cutaneous circulation" -- cardiac output
# reserve genuinely inadequate for the COMBINED demand, and cutaneous
# vasodilator response itself is measurably attenuated (unlike obesity, where
# the sudomotor/vasomotor effectors were largely intact -- see the obesity
# entry above). This is exactly HESTIA's own CVR conjunctive criterion
# (T_rect exceedance AND CO_reserve <= 0), independently corroborating that
# construct. Classic work (Rowell) shows this competing-demand deficit is
# specifically revealed under COMBINED exercise+heat stress, not passive
# heat exposure alone -- i.e. precisely the event-participant scenario PYROX
# and HESTIA both model.
#
# ACCLIMATIZATION -- a genuinely reassuring finding, not just a gap-filler:
# unlike obesity, the literature does NOT support cutting acclimatization
# capacity further. Heat acclimatization combined with exercise training
# measurably reduced ischemic injury after cardiac surgery in coronary artery
# disease patients (Horowitz & Hasin 2023, Front Physiol, 30 years of
# heat-acclimation-mediated cross-tolerance research, doi:10.3389/
# fphys.2023.1074391), and CAD patients show real peak-VO2 improvement with
# training (HIIT vs MICT meta-analysis, though this specific benefit was NOT
# significant for heart-failure patients specifically -- PMC9203221). Given
# this PYROX group spans the whole cardiovascular-disease spectrum (not just

# antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics) show NO measured core-
# temperature effect during heat stress -- despite being routinely listed
# together as equally risky (CDC 2025 clinical guidance; WHO). Proven,
# quantified core-temperature increases were found only for: strong
# anticholinergics (ACB=3), +0.42°C at ambient >=30C (95% CI 0.04-0.79),
# via reduced sweating; non-selective beta-blockers, +0.11°C (95% CI
# 0.02-0.19), via reduced cutaneous vasodilation; and anti-Parkinson's
# agents, +0.13°C (95% CI 0.07-0.19). This does not mean diuretics/
# antipsychotics are safe in heat -- they may still raise real-world risk via
# dehydration/electrolyte disturbance or sedation-driven reduction in heat-
# avoidance behaviour -- but those are different mechanisms than direct

# with histopathological evidence (doi:10.1186/s13195-024-01515-7).
# MEDICATION: cholinesterase inhibitors (standard dementia pharmacotherapy,
# e.g. donepezil) reduce sweating -- a distinct, well-documented mechanism
# from the antipsychotic effects already captured in medication_impaired
# (some overlap expected, as many dementia patients with behavioural
# symptoms are prescribed both drug classes).
# COMPOUNDING, less physiologically representable: communication/behavioural
# deficits (may not recognise thirst, forget to drink, not understand the
# need to remove clothing or seek shade; heat-induced confusion/agitation can
# be mistaken for baseline dementia symptoms, delaying intervention) -- as
# with severe_mental_illness, this secondary pathway is not something
# PYROX's four protective knobs can represent, but here it compounds an
# already well-evidenced DIRECT physiological mechanism rather than being the
# primary driver.
# [flagged for review] No number change beyond documentation: this is the
# single most severe group in the entire 23-group roster (below even the
# paper-validated very_elderly_85plus prototype at 0.25), and the evidence
# located here is, if anything, more direct/robust than for
# severe_mental_illness -- supporting rather than challenging that ranking.

# Walking events draw a very different field from running events: older
# participants, children, and people with chronic conditions who would never
# enter a race. Those are exactly the groups PYROX was built around, and
# three of them (adults_18_45, elderly_65_85, very_elderly_85plus) carry the
# PUBLISHED parameterisation rather than the extrapolated one the athlete
# groups use. Walking is also a better fit for the model itself: 2.5-4 MET
# sits inside the range the heat-load coefficient was fitted on, and a
# multi-hour walking day matches the shift length its weighting assumes.
# Default speed 5 km/h (12.0 min/km) except where a slower pace is typical.
