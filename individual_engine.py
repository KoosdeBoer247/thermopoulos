individual_engine.py
=====================
A single-person, on-demand wrapper around the same JOS-3 + CVR physiology
engine and dose-response calibration that already power PYROX's
population-level apps (app.py, app_beleid.py, app_athletes.py) -- built
for exactly one real person's own biometrics and one real event, instead
of a sampled population of a few thousand virtual participants.

Nothing in the physiology or calibration is reimplemented here.
calculate_indices_jos3_adult(), AdultParticipantProfile,
cumulative_deficit_dose() and dose_response_ehs_probability() are the
exact same functions the population apps call -- this module only
supplies a different SOURCE of participant profiles: one real person,
described once, instead of thousands sampled from a distribution.

PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE
---------------------
Personal data entered here (height, weight, age, pace, ...) and every
outcome derived from it (T_rect trace, CO_reserve trace, EHS estimate)
never leave this process. The only network calls anywhere in this
module's call graph are the two Thermopoulos already uses for the
population apps:
    geocode_city_candidates()          -- place name  -> lat/lon/timezone
    fetch_hourly_forecast() /
    fetch_historical_data()            -- lat/lon/date -> weather
Both were checked directly against Thermopoulos_Data_Engine.py's actual
outgoing request parameters (see PYROX_WINDOWS_PRIVACY.md): they send
latitude, longitude, date(s) and units -- never any field of
PersonalInputs. No analytics, telemetry, or other outbound call exists
in this module or in what it imports.

That guarantee covers this module's code. Two more steps make it hold
for the packaged application as a whole, and are NOT this module's
responsibility -- see PYROX_WINDOWS_PACKAGING.md:
    1. Streamlit's own anonymous usage telemetry (on by default) must be
       disabled via .streamlit/config.toml.
    2. The local server must bind to 127.0.0.1, not 0.0.0.0, so nothing
       else on the network can reach it.

WHY AN ENSEMBLE, NOT ONE DETERMINISTIC RUN
-------------------------------------------
generate_base_population() (hestia_model.py) samples roughly fifteen
fields per virtual participant to represent a whole population. For one
real, named individual most of those fields are directly knowable
(height, weight, age, gender, pace) and are FIXED here to the entered
value -- resampling a known quantity would just add fake noise on top
of a real number.

But a handful of the sampled fields were never standing in for
between-PERSON variability alone; they represent things that are
genuinely unknowable in advance even for one specific person on one
specific day:
    kp_pacing        -- interoceptive / motivational pacing response
    wind_angle_rad    -- course heading vs. wind direction (untracked)
    sweat_factor,
    pct_vo2max noise -- day-to-day physiological variation
    temp/rh offset   -- course microclimate vs. weather-station siting
Collapsing all of these to one point guess would produce a single,
falsely precise trace -- exactly the failure mode this suite's own
population-level EHS figure ran into (see uncertainty.py). Instead this
module runs a small personal ensemble: every entered field held fixed,
only this short list re-drawn per member from the same conditional
distributions generate_base_population() already uses, and reports a
band, not a line.

The EHS probability returned here reuses uncertainty.py's sampling +
anchor interval machinery directly, and inherits the same caveat: it
does not cover the dose-response slope, which is not identified from
the present calibration set. See uncertainty.py's module docstring.

# =============================================================================
# Conjunctive criteria
# =============================================================================
#: The author's own conjunctive EHS criterion: T_rect >= 40.5 C AND
#: CO_reserve <= 0 AT THE SAME TIMESTEP. 40.5 C after Roberts (2010).
EHS_T_THRESHOLD  = 40.5
EHS_CO_THRESHOLD = 0.0

#: --- EHE: Exertional Heat Exhaustion -------------------------------------
#: T_rect > 39.5 C AND CO_reserve < 0 at the SAME timestep, DURING exertion.
#:
#: Formerly labelled "collapse" in this module; renamed 2026-08-17 after
#: checking the definitions against the literature. The clinical entity
#: this matches is exertional heat exhaustion (ACSM Expert Consensus
#: Statement on Exertional Heat Illness, 2023): core temperature
#: typically 38.5-40 C, inability to continue, WITHOUT the CNS
#: dysfunction that defines EHS. 39.5 C sits inside that band.
#: "Collapse" was the wrong word: in the sports-medicine literature
#: that term denotes EAC (see below), a different entity with the
#: opposite pathophysiology.
#:
#: WHAT THIS CRITERION ACTUALLY MEANS -- checked empirically against
#: this model's own output (2026-08-17), not assumed:
#: Following ensemble members from the moment they first meet it, T_rect
#: does NOT then climb to the 40.5 C EHS threshold. It plateaus: of 40
#: warned members at 31 C, exactly one later reached 40.5 C, and that
#: one was already above it when warned. The state is stable in
#: temperature, not a slope toward heat stroke.
#: But CO_reserve keeps falling at that plateau (e.g. -0.10 -> -0.46
#: over five 10-min steps at a constant 40.14 C). MET stays essentially
#: flat over the same span (11.04 -> 11.00, i.e. 0.4%), so pacing is NOT
#: what stabilises the temperature -- a genuine thermal steady state is,
#: while dehydration erodes CO_max underneath it.
#: So the criterion marks LOST CONTROL MARGIN, not impending
#: hyperthermia: temperature is being held only because heat production
#: and loss happen to balance, while the capacity to answer any further
#: disturbance (a climb, a sheltered windless stretch, a finishing
#: sprint) is disappearing. In control terms: the regulated variable
#: looks fine while the actuator reserve runs out.
#: This is why EHE_dose (the integral of the deficit over time) is the
#: more informative output than the yes/no flag -- erosion is the
#: phenomenon, not threshold-crossing.
#:
#: Independent confirmation (2026-08-19): Kong et al., "Exceeding human
#: heat tolerance in a warming, ageing world" (Lancet Planet Health,
#: 2026) cites chamber-experiment evidence from the same PSU HEAT
#: Project lineage (Cottle et al. 2024, J Appl Physiol) that
#: "cardiovascular strain, indicated by a sustained increase in heart
#: rate, occurs before core temperature begins to rise continuously."
#: That is the same temporal ordering this criterion targets -- found
#: independently, in a different age group (middle-aged, 40-59) and a
#: different exposure type (resting/ADL heat exposure, not exercise),
#: which is exactly the kind of independent replication a single-anchor,
#: uncalibrated criterion like this one benefits from. It does not
#: calibrate EHE (their thresholds are for near-resting metabolic rate,
#: an order of magnitude below marathon MET, so the exposure regime does
#: not transfer directly) -- but it corroborates the mechanism.
#:
#: NOT the same construct as hestia_model.py's existing `p_collapse`
#: two-phase logistic. That model reads t_rect_max_per_sim (maximum over
#: the whole trace) and res_min (minimum over the whole trace)
#: INDEPENDENTLY, so a T_rect peak at 11:00 and a CO_reserve trough at
#: 13:00 both contribute even though they never co-occurred. This
#: criterion is strictly simultaneous.
#:
#: NOT calibrated against observed EHE incidence -- no anchor dataset
#: exists for it, so this module reports it as a FRACTION OF THE
#: ENSEMBLE and never converts it to a rate per 1000.
EHE_T_THRESHOLD  = 39.5
EHE_CO_THRESHOLD = 0.0

#: --- EAC: Exercise-Associated Collapse ------------------------------------
#: CO_reserve < 0 in the POST-FINISH window only. No temperature
#: requirement -- deliberately.
#:
#: EAC (Asplund & O'Connor 2011; Roberts 2007; StatPearls) is collapse in
#: a CONSCIOUS athlete who cannot stand or walk unaided, occurring after
#: an endurance event. Its mechanism is postural hypotension: the muscle
#: pump stops at the finish line, cutaneous vasodilation persists, venous
#: return falls, and cerebral perfusion follows. It is cardiovascular,
#: not thermal -- which is why imposing a temperature threshold here
#: would be wrong, not merely conservative. Asplund's own guidance is
#: that collapse DURING a race points to some other, more serious cause.
#:
#: This is the one criterion in this module with a real external anchor:
#: the Gothenburg Half Marathon reports 1.53 EAC cases per 1000 runners,
#: and EAC accounts for 59-85% of finish-line medical-tent visits. That
#: makes it the first candidate since Falmouth for calibrating an
#: absolute rate rather than a relative signal. Not attempted here --
#: reported as an ensemble fraction like the others, pending a proper
#: dose-response fit against that anchor.
EAC_CO_THRESHOLD = 0.0

#: Minimum accumulated post-finish deficit (L/min x minutes) before EAC
#: is counted. Requiring merely ONE crossing of zero produced obvious
#: false positives: measured on a severe scenario (30 C, 3 h, 5:00/km),
#: 40% of the population had at least one negative post-finish step, but
#: HALF of those had exactly one 30-second step before recovering. A
#: single half-minute dip is not a collapse -- it is the ordinary
#: blood-pressure drop on stopping, which simulate_post_finish() itself
#: documents as a validated acute dip that occurs and recovers inside
#: this window. Someone who actually collapses stays down for minutes.
#:
#: The empirical distribution has a clear knee: raising the threshold
#: from 0 to 0.5 drops the count from 40% to 15%, after which it is
#: nearly flat (15% at 1.0, 12.5% at 2.0). 0.5 therefore sits at the
#: elbow -- it removes the single-step transients without cutting into
#: the sustained cases.
#:
#: This does NOT make the count a clinical incidence. Meeting a
#: mechanistic precondition is not the same as the syndrome: real EAC
#: additionally requires cerebral hypoperfusion, an upright posture and
#: a moment. The count therefore still sits orders of magnitude above
#: observed incidence (1.53 per 1000, Gothenburg Half Marathon), exactly
#: as the EHS criterion count does against Falmouth. Calibrating against
#: the Gothenburg anchor -- the way pct_dose_response_ehs is calibrated
#: against Falmouth -- remains the outstanding work that would turn this
#: into a genuine rate.

    single final total. A given member's points sweep from dose=0
    toward their own final_dose as their simulated race progresses;
    colour them accordingly rather than reading each point as an
    independent "total".

    Also returns a `phase` array ('race' | 'postfinish') per point.
    This matters because the race and post-finish windows can look
    like two visually separate clusters: cardiac output reserve tends
    to rebound quickly once someone stops (recovering demand), while
    T_rect lags and stays elevated a little longer -- a real
    "afterdrop"-style physiological pattern, not a plotting artefact.
    Without a phase label, that split is easy to misread as a bug the
    first time someone sees it.

    finish. A static chart does not make this distinction visible by
    itself; this function computes it directly from the trace.

    These two exits are not equivalent. Exiting post-finish is largely
    a consequence of simulate_post_finish() feeding the CVR model
    resting metabolic rate (PF_MET_RUST) instead of race-pace MET:
    cardiac output demand collapses once running stops, which can pull
    CO_reserve back above zero even while T_rect is still elevated (see
    the note on this in this module's docstring history). That is a
    mechanical consequence of stopping, not evidence the thermal danger
    resolved. Exiting the zone DURING the race means the danger
    genuinely eased while the person was still under load -- a
    meaningfully more reassuring pattern, and worth telling apart in
    plain language for a non-expert reader.
