Thermopoulos.Meteodata v3.1 - Extended Historical Data Engine
==============================================================

Standalone console-executable meteorological data acquisition and processing
engine for the Thermopoulos heat-stress modeling suite.

NEW in v3.1:
- wind_speed_unit="ms" added explicitly to all Open-Meteo API requests.
  Open-Meteo default is km/h; without this parameter wind_10m would be
  stored in km/h in the Excel output while all downstream calculations
  (wind_speed_at_height, globe temperature, MRT, JOS-3, UTCI) assume m/s.
  This fix affects fetch_hourly_forecast() and fetch_historical_data().
  Verified against Open-Meteo API documentation (Settings section,
  default wind speed unit = km/h). March 2026.

NEW in v3.0:
- Automatic 14-day hindcast (historical data before forecast)
- Optional custom historical period selection
- Multi-sheet Excel export (Forecast / Hindcast / Custom Historical)
- Unified processing pipeline for all data types
- Enhanced data validation and error handling

Features from v2.2:
- Interactive city selection
- Hourly meteorological data from Open-Meteo
- Urban Heat Island (UHI) correction (Pre-radiation calculation)
- Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) via ISO 7726 (HESTIA-consistent)
- UTCI & WBGT calculations
- Vectorized performance for high-speed processing

UTCI CALCULATION NOTES:
- UTCI is calculated using the pythermalcomfort library
- Valid input ranges per UTCI standard:
  * Temperature: -50 to +50°C
  * Wind speed: 0.5 to 17 m/s (1.8 to 61.2 km/h)
  * Relative humidity: 5 to 100%
- Wind values outside this range are automatically clipped
- Column 'UTCI_valid' flags where original wind was within standard range
- UTCI values for clipped wind should be interpreted with caution
- For high wind conditions (>17 m/s), UTCI represents extrapolated estimates

# of 0.92°C across race-window hours; peak=3.0 reduced that to 0.47°C, with
# the error now split roughly symmetrically (sometimes slightly low, sometimes
# slightly high) rather than consistently biased in one direction -- a good
