HESTIA individual-tier bridge — live-interactive, without blocking the app
=============================================================================
Wraps hestia_model.run_monte_carlo_adult for use inside a Streamlit session
that must stay responsive. Three real bottlenecks were found and fixed (see
hestia_model.py's own patched functions for the detail); this module adds a
fourth layer: a two-tier N so "live and always responds quickly" and
"full-precision Monte Carlo" don't have to be the same request.

PROFILED (network stubbed, 60-minute event, this sandbox's hardware):
    ~133 ms / draw of pure JOS-3 compute, single process.
    n=100  -> ~13 s        n=1000 -> ~130 s (2.2 min)
    n=200  -> ~27 s        n=5000 -> ~660 s (11 min)
Longer events cost proportionally more per draw (JOS-3 steps through every
interpolated timestep). These are lower bounds from one machine; actual
Streamlit Cloud wall-clock is unverified and likely higher, since
multiprocessing.cpu_count() on a shared container often overstates the
cores actually available.

DESIGN: a "quick estimate" (small n, default) runs live inline, capped in
size to keep the wait in the range of seconds rather than minutes, cached
by scenario so repeat views are instant. A "full precision" run is never
triggered automatically -- it requires an explicit button press, shows an
honest time estimate first, and updates a progress bar as results arrive
rather than blocking silently.

TWO FIXES CARRIED BY THIS BRIDGE (not by hestia_model.py's callers):
  1. get_timezone() is monkey-patched to the ALREADY-KNOWN IANA timezone
     from the app's own geocoding step, rather than re-deriving it from
     lat/lon via TimezoneFinder -- more reliable, and sidesteps needing a
     package with no Python 3.12 wheel.
  2. get_air_quality() is monkey-patched to a value fetched ONCE per
     scenario (not per draw, not per worker) -- see hestia_model.py's own
     docstring on this function for why the uncached version was a real
     bottleneck.

# =============================================================================
# Sizing
# =============================================================================
#: Default "quick estimate" sample size. ~13s single-process per the
#: profiling above; real deployments should re-measure once on their own
#: hardware (see time_estimate_seconds) rather than trust this blindly.
QUICK_N = 100

#: Ceiling on worker-pool size. Two considerations cap this, not just CPU:
#: 1. multiprocessing.cpu_count() on a shared container can overstate real
#:    availability -- more workers than real cores adds overhead, not speed.
#: 2. MEMORY. Profiled: importing this app's own baseline (streamlit,
#:    plotly, pandas, numpy, pythermalcomfort, rasterio) plus hestia_model
#:    (which pulls in matplotlib/seaborn/scipy) costs ~384MB in a single
#:    process before any simulation runs. fork-based multiprocessing.Pool
#:    (Linux default) shares that baseline across workers via copy-on-write,
#:    but each worker accumulates its own private memory as it actually
#:    simulates (result arrays, mutable state) -- so total memory grows with
#:    worker count during a run, not just at import. Streamlit Community
#:    Cloud's free tier has limited RAM (commonly reported around 1GB,
#:    unverified for this specific deployment). Capped conservatively at 2
#:    rather than a CPU-driven higher number, trading some wall-clock speed
#:    for a materially lower out-of-memory risk. Raise this only after
#:    confirming on the actual deployed container that memory headroom
#:    allows it -- an OOM kill on Streamlit Cloud looks identical to the
#:    "Oh no" crash screen documented in HANDLEIDING.md, with no traceback,
#:    so it is easy to misdiagnose as a code bug rather than a resource limit.

    Exertional Heat Stroke at the Falmouth Road Race." J Athl Train.
    2014;49(4):478-485. 18 years of medical-tent records (12 years with
    finisher counts) at the Falmouth Road Race (7 miles / 11.3 km,
    ~10,000 runners, elite to novice). EHS defined as rectal temp
    >=40degC with CNS dysfunction -- the same clinical definition
    HESTIA's own conjunctive criterion targets.

    Regression (their Fig. 2, fit on n=12 individual race-years):
        EHS per 1000 finishers = 0.004 * exp(0.250 * Tamb_degC)
        R^2 = 0.653, P = .001
    Verified here against their Table 1 (12 individual year values):
    mean absolute deviation ~0.64 per 1000 across the fitted range
    (21.3-27.7 degC) -- a real, moderate-strength epidemiological fit,
    not an exact match to any single year.

    WHY THIS EXISTS: extensive testing this session (see project history)
    found HESTIA's own raw physiological "true EHS criterion" simulation
    over-predicts Falmouth's actual, published EHS incidence by roughly
    20-53x across a comparable temperature range, while the RELATIVE
    temperature-sensitivity (how fast risk grows per degree) was
    reasonably close between the two (suggesting a scale/calibration
    issue more than a broken shape). Pending a full re-derivation of
    HESTIA's own internal calibration (a larger undertaking -- see
    project notes on production-scale intercept re-estimation), this
    formula is used as the PRIMARY, real-data-anchored EHS estimate
    shown to users. HESTIA's raw simulation output remains available
    but is clearly labelled as uncalibrated.

    LIMITATIONS, stated plainly:
      - Fitted on ONE specific race: a 7-mile (~11 km) point-to-point
        event with a broad recreational-to-elite field. Applying it to
        a very different distance, duration, or participant population
        is itself an approximation, not a validated transfer.
      - R^2 = 0.653 means the temperature-fitted curve explains about
        two-thirds of the year-to-year variance in the real data --
        real years scatter meaningfully above and below this line.
      - Uses race-window MEAN ambient temperature, matching the
        original paper's own methodology (their Tamb is a race-window
        average, not a peak).

    Falmouth's own temperature-only regression (falmouth_ehs_per_1000) as
    the floor instead of the logistic curve's fixed global intercept.

    WHY: the global logistic's floor (dose=0 -> ~1.7 per 1000, from
    _DOSE_RESPONSE_A) is CONSTANT regardless of ambient temperature,
    because it was fit jointly across only 5 scenarios all sitting in
    22-34degC -- it has no information about what happens outside that
    range. Checked directly: at 5degC it still reads ~1.7 per 1000, while
    Falmouth's own temperature curve (the same data source the logistic
    was fit to match) gives ~0.01 per 1000 there -- a >100x gap, and
    demonstrably the wrong direction for cold conditions.

    NOT SHIPPED: a full replacement fitting a new dose-slope from scratch
    against a temperature-anchored floor. Tried it (2026-08-13, session
    notes): at the reference scenarios (MET~10.5, ~96min, 22-34degC),
    forcing the floor to exactly equal the Falmouth temperature target
    leaves the joint fit no room for a positive dose-slope to add
    anything without overshooting the target -- at this reference
    condition, dose and temperature are essentially confounded (dose only
    turns non-zero at the hot end, since MET is held fixed), so the
    fitted slope collapses to ~0. Properly separating a dose effect from
    a temperature effect needs scenarios where they're NOT confounded --
    e.g. a hot/easy-pace vs a cool/hard-pace comparison, which is exactly
    the kind of scenario this app surfaced in practice (a fast recreational
    pace reaching the danger criterion mid-race at only moderate ambient
    temperature). That is a genuine follow-up calibration task, not
    something this patch invents a number for.

    This patch therefore leaves dose>0 behaviour COMPLETELY UNCHANGED
    (still the original, imperfect global logistic) and only corrects the
    dose=0 case, which is both the most common case in practice and the
    one with an unambiguous, directly-checkable real-data answer.

    regardless of conditions, including hot-weather running kit (shorts +
    t-shirt + socks + shoes), which standard clo tables put at ~0.2-0.3, not
    0.5. Tested directly: at ~32degC/MET 10.5/96min, clo=0.5 gave a median
    peak race-phase T_rect of 41.4degC with 93% of the simulated population
    exceeding the clinical EHS threshold (40.5degC) -- clo=0.2 brought that
    to 40.0degC median and 8%, much closer to real measured data (Veltmeijer
    et al. 2014, JSAMS: 15% >=40degC in a 15km race, albeit in COOLER
    WBGT=11degC conditions -- so some elevation above 15% would still be
    expected at 32degC; 8% may itself run slightly low, worth revisiting
    once production-scale validation is done). This was the single largest
    contributor found in that investigation to HESTIA's T_rect
    over-prediction -- larger than any single factor found in the earlier
    CO_reserve/CHSI work.
